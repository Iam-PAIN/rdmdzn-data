I found out most of the competetion is using Generic looking rigid wordmarks along with old style icons as their branding whereas the client wanted something opposite. That is why while designing the logo for the brand I focused on the key factors of Drycleano  which are being Friendly, Trustable and giving Ease of Mind to the customers.\nI used a combination logo for the brand which consists a playful wordmark along with  a friendly mascot which is based on the Washing Machine. The color palette is made up of Yellow and Blue to convey the cheerfullness and Trust factor of the brand. WHile using a font pair I used a simple sans serif font to complement the Playfull Logo Font. ",
